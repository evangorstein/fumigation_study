Analysis of microbial data from a study of the effect of fumigation in golf course soil. 

- Fungal abundances from ITS amplification and bacterial abundances from 16S amplification are in `data`.

- `nmds.R` runs non-metric multidimensional scaling on both fungal and bacterial count matrices.

- `bact_anal.R` fits microbial networks to bacteria data.

- `fung_anal.R` fits microbial networks to fungal data.
